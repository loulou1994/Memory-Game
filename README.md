# Memory Game

Here's a modern-day memory game delivered to you by Me :smirk:. The design concept and styling was provided by the [frontendmentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) website. In this project I tried setting up my own webpack configuration file without using react's third-party libraries such as create-react-app
